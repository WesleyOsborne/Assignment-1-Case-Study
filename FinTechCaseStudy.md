## Overview and Origin

Wealthsimple is an online brokerage founded in January of 2014 by Michael Katchen and Rudy Alder. The company started with the goal to provide smart, simple investing without the high fees and account minimums associated with traditional brokerages and banks. Wealthsimple is funded by 17 main investors including; Greylock and Meritech Capital Partners. Total funding raised as of May 3, 2021 is approximately 1.1 billion. However, most of their income comes from the 1.5% exchange fee charged for USD-CAD conversion. 

## Business Activities

Before the emergence of brokerages like Wealthsimple and Robinhood, personal investing was seen to be very difficult to the average individual. Instead most individuals would use a brokerage or their bank to invest their money on behalf of themselves. These brokerages and banks would charge transaction fees on every trade and typically require a minimum account balance. 

Wealthsimple decided to solve this problem by creating a company which made it easier for the everyday individuals to invest with zero dollar commision fees on trades. The challenge however was to make an investing platform that is simple enough for the everyday user. They wanted a platform that is simple to use, affordable, accessible and personalized in order to help everyone reach their financial goals. Accomplishing this, simplistic network for investing with zero commision trading, has allowed Wealthsimple to attract all demographics who are interested in doing their own finances. Currently Wealthsimple has over 6 million web visits per month, with 84% of their clientele living in Canada.  

In order to provide this simplistic program and run an effective business Wealthsimple uses a variety of technologies. Some simple programs include; mobile app metrics and web tech stack. These programs give wealthsimple the ability to be used both on web browsers and mobile devices. This is very important as it provides the consumer with the ability to trade and check their balances from anywhere in the world. Other more advanced programs can fall into 4 categories; Application and data, Utilities, DevOps, and Business Tools. 

### Application and Data
Wealthsimple uses 29 different software programs to help with their application and development. Some of these include; javascript, AngularJS, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, etc. These programs allow for the interaction between multiple software applications as well as an area to store and compute data.
### Utilities
Wealthsimple uses 9 utility software to aid their development which include; Postman, Swagger UI, AWS IAM, Periscope, etc. This software helps Wealthsimple to analyze, configure, optimize and maintain their program and overall business model.
### DevOps
Wealthsimple uses 17 programs to help with their program development including; GitHub, Git, Gulp, Consul, Rollbar, etc. These programs are specific to the development of their online and mobile platforms such as the coding for the program.
### Business Tools
Last Wealthsimple uses 6 different programs to help run their business, including; Slack, Jira, Zendesk, Quip, etc. These technologies are used to keep their business running successfully through aspects like communication, rather then helping the specific program development itself.  

## Landscape
All these programs have caused Wealthsimple to become a dominant company in the wealth management, personal finance and online investing fields. They have bridged the gap from not only creating a simple environment for online investing but also adding zero commision fees on their trades. Wealthsimple is one of the first online investing firms in Canada with this strategy. They have tried to enter the USA and UK markets but have found it difficult based on some strong competitors such as robinhood and webull. Being a Canadian company, Wealthsimple has a great variety of stocks and ETFS listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. However, compared to its competitors Wealthsimple lacks the diversity of USA companies compared to Robinhood and Webull which is making it more difficult for them to enter the US markets. 

## Results & Recommendations

Wealthsimple has been able to provide a simple online investing service with zero commision fees which has distances itself from other Canadian companies. There 175,000 users, 1.1 billion in funding and market cap of 8.4 billion demonstrates their dominance among the canadian market. However in order to expand into other markets (USA and UK) Wealthsimple is going to have increase the amount of investment options in these locations. Secondly competitors like Robinhood offer more cryptocurrencies on their platform. Cryptocurrencies are currently increasing in demand and interest. My individuals are looking to cryptocurries as the future of value and a way to hedge against inflation. Increasing your offerings for this service besides your current listings of just Bitcoin and Ethereum would attract more users to your platform. Adding more cryptocurrencies should not be difficult as they have already listed 2 on their platform. The second suggestion is simply to list more stocks and ETFs on your platform. Adding more USA stocks and ETFs would help you enter the American Market. Individuals are still frustrated with what Robinhood did during the WallStreetBest/Gamestop situation and are looking for another option. Moving fast and taking advantage of Robinhoods' mistake could help gain an advantage in the US market. Thirdly looking to add more exchanges such as OTC markets and Nasdaq alonside margin trading. Both these exchanges and trading options would drive more experienced investors to use your platform rather then just the average individual. Lastly, the ability to invest in commodities would drive more individuals to use your platform. 

Wealthsimple has become a dominant online investing brokerage in Canada. Their simplistic platform alongside their zero commission trading has allowed Wealthsimple to get ahead of the competition. However in order to coontinue building their business I belieeve Wealthsimple add more investment options to their platform including; Cryptocurrencies, Commodities, International Stocks and ETFs and more exchanges.
